# Bouncing Baby Balls

## Description

"Bouncing Baby Balls" is an interactive web application that simulates colourful balls bouncing within a confined space. This is mainly to keep focus of your young one focused and help with gentle sensory stimulation. It allows parents to customise the animation, including the number and size of balls, and features sound effects for collisions and optional background music. I built it for my nephews and nieces, and kids, so I would be updating it as I learn more about how to safely guide attention and neural stimulation.

**Key Features:**

*   **Interactive Animation:** Watch balls bounce and collide realistically.
*   **Customization via Modal (üîß):**
    *   Set the number of red and black balls (0-10 each).
    *   Adjust the ball size (radius).
    *   Toggle "Boop" sound effects for collisions.
    *   Play background music by providing a URL.
*   **Collision Physics & Sound:** Balls collide with each other and the canvas walls, triggering "boop" sounds using Tone.js.
*   **User Controls:**
    *   **Start / Stop ‚èØÔ∏è:** Toggles the animation (also `Spacebar`).
    *   **Randomize:** Resets the animation with a new random set of balls.
    *   **Configure (Esc) üîß:** Opens a modal for detailed settings.
    *   **Full Screen:** Toggles full-screen mode for the animation canvas.
*   **Responsive Design:** The canvas adapts to different window sizes.
